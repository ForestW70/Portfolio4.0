* # Additional comments
  - will for sure be updating this constantly. my first big dive into react and I love it, things are so easy. 

  - I'd like to add a blog feature to my site using a more MERN approach. (minus the E.) Also need to make this tab mobile responsive. For future deployment.

  - I hope whoever grading this isn't cringing at the header. there are plans to give it a chill mode but for now this is all I got.
