* # Additional comments
  - will for sure be updating this constantly. my first big dive into React.js and I love it.

  - I'd like to add a blog feature to my site using a more MERN approach. (minus the E.) Also need to make this tab mobile responsive. For future deployment. EDIT: Decided to scrap the Blog idea. I like the idea of keeping track of personal projects, but I'll save this feature for a future time when I have more to share.
