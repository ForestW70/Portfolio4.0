                <p>Currently a student at George Washington University's Full Stack web development bootcamp, Forest Wilson is now online. Prior to these courses, Forest has arranged a large pool of skills in areas such as marketing, finance, graphic design, and customer service. He also has plenty of first-hand experience with Microsoft and Adobe suites, as well as digital-audio workspaces such as FL studio and Logic X.</p>
                <p>Initially, Forest was enrolled in the computer engineering program at Drexel University, however he quickly found out his entrepreneurial spirit was more fit for a business path. After graduating with a marketing degree, he still could not shake his love for computers and tech, so he began to study the ins and outs of website development. Soon to be graduate of George Washington University's full-stack web development program, Forest has big plans to use his abundance of skills to transition into starting his own business; focused on visual design, and finding ways for artists to best represent their work online and in the real world.</p>
