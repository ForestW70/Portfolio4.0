                        <strong>Forest is a Full stack web developer</strong> foremost, and has developed over 20 applications utilizing the core web languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) in conjunction with other technologies and packages such as:
                        Node.js, React.js, Next.js, Bootstrap, MySql, MongoDB, Express, Jest, Handlebars, JQuery, Sequelize, Mongoose, IndexedDB, JWTs, Babel, Apollo, Axios, and GraphQL. He also has experience with NPM/NPX/Yarn, ESLint, Encryption, Cookies, Postman/Insomnia, and PWAs/Service workers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He earned his Full-stack web development certificate from The George Washington University's 6 month coding bootcamp program, but behind the scenes, <strong>Forest likes to use his experience to develop music-oriented applications for the web,</strong> as well as creating personal, professional, and responsive websites for companies and indivuals.
                        He is also very familiar with <strong>VSCode, Github/Git, and Microsoft/Adobe suite programs such as Excel, Photoshop, and Illustrator.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To add to the pot, he also has years of experience in fields such as Marketing/Economics, Service-sector/Communication, and IT Helpdesk/Office administration.
                        The master plan is to one day wrap up all of these skills and create a vibrant online community of creators, where they can have a stylish and accessible web application to display, market, and sell their work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the mean time, Forest is ready build-up his repertoire of front-end, back-end, and UX/UI skills to the max, and he's <strong>not afraid of the hard work</strong> it will take to achieve this. He is committed to designing creative and accessible applications, as well as developing a quality product with as few compromises as possible.

                        Behind the scenes, Forest likes to find new ways to use his development experience to build music-oriented applications for the web, and for creating music in tandem with FL Studio and Garage band.
