                    As a recent graduate from George Washington University's Full Stack web development bootcamp, Forest Wilson is now online. 
                    Prior to these courses, Forest has arranged a large pool of skills in areas such as marketing, finance, graphic design, and customer service. 
                    He also has plenty of first-hand experience with Microsoft and Adobe suites, as well as digital-audio workspaces such as FL studio and Logic X.

                    Initially, Forest was enrolled in the computer engineering program at Drexel University, however he quickly found out his entrepreneurial spirit was more fit for a business path. 
                    Despite taking away many skills from the business arts, he still could not shake his love for computers and tech, so he began to study the ins and outs of web development. 
                    Although he has always had big plans to use his abundance of skills to start his own business; focused on visual design, and finding ways for artists to best represent their work online and in the real world, 
                    Forest is now ready to start his career with a company that sees his communication and technological skills as the incredible asset it is, allowing him to work with teams to develop a product that is precisely what the user wants to see on the web.
