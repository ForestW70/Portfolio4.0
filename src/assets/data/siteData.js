Hell, project 3 is currently still in the works (which by the way is going to be a incredible music database app), but soon I'll be done and have so much to show for it. After this is all said and done, I plan on going back to each project, refactor my very choppy JS, and polish each layout to try and capture what my vision was for each and every one. However, my first order of business will be to actually add a blog feature for myself here, because I will probably not have time before the end to really have this portfolio the way I want it, so stay tuned!",
